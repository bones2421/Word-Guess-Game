Word Guess
is a hangman style game where the user is shown a set of blanks with an image. They are to guess the word by using the number of blanks present and the image as hints. If the user gets the letter right, it goes in the blanks, if its wrong a sound is played and they see that they got it wrong. There is a counter for wrong guesses as well. It will not count against the user if they already guessed the letter.
